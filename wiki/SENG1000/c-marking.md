### Professionalism Mark (10% of total grade)

The professionalism mark is gained simply by filling out each of the 10 weekly check-ins posted by Carlo every Thursday. This is a completion mark, so it should be really easy to achieve.

### Assignments

#### Marking Procedure

Carlo marks assignments based on the EMRF rubric found in the first section of this page, and considers the following:

> Does this work demonstrate understanding of the concepts and meet the expectations outlined in the assignment and course requirements?

This means that one could easily achieve an excellent mark simply by adhering strictly to the SET standards that apply to the assignment, and putting reasonable effort into gaining an understanding of the course material.

#### Mini Assignments (8% of total grade)

Mini assignments are assignments designed to be easy, to gauge a student's understanding of the core concepts explored in the course. There will be 7 mini assignments hroughout the course, each but the last worth 1%, with the last being worth 2%. Mini assignments may be graded on fewer EMRF levels than major ones

#### Major Assignments (20% of total grade)

#### Late Submission Policy

Major assignment submission is subject to a 1-hour grace period following the deadline. This **does not** apply to mini assignments.
